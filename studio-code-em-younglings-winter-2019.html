<h1>Day 1</h1>
<h2>Intro to Computer Science</h2>
<p>History of Computer Science, and Computers. Talking about the progress we have made in the last couple decades, and ending with the transistor.</p>
<h2>Out of Desk</h2>
<p>We will go over Lightbot first on the whiteboard, and then we will act out how it works by having one person play the programmer, and one person play the robot. The programmer will have to program the "human robot" with instructions in order to get it to move certain area of the room. We will see how putting these instructions in the correct order is crucial, we will also mention the concept of efficiency, and how we can work to make our programs more efficient.</p>
<h2>Hands On</h2>
<p>Kids will start with using the iPads along with an app called Lightbot. There they have to program a robot using the instructions that Lightbot provides. The first section of Lightbot focuses on sequences, and putting groups of instructions into code blocks, preparing us for procedures.</p>
<h2>One Thing to Remember</h2>
<p>Instructions and sequences. The students should be familiar, and comfortable organizing instructions into the correct order to produce the outcome that they want. Lightbot gives us the chance to do this by maneuvering out robot through the obstacle course until he has completed everything.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<h2>Actual</h2>
<p>We started off with the reveal deck, and went through the history of computers ending our discussion with transistors, and taking a look at the vacuum tubes. We talked a bit about computer programming, and went over Lightbot using the white board.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Day 2</h1>
<h2>Base 10 and Base 2 Number Systems</h2>
<p>We reviewed the history of computers, and talked about vacuum tubes, and transistors. Next we introduced how the Binary Number system relates to all this, and computer science.</p>
<h2>Out of Desk</h2>
<p>We will start with going over the Base 10 number system which we are familiar with, and know as decimal. Then we will introduce what computers use to speak which is known as the Base 2 system, or the Binary number system. Using the white board we will go through converting 1-10 in decimal to binary and make sure we have a solid understanding of it.</p>
<h2>Hands On/Coding</h2>
<p>We will continue our progress with Lightbot. We ended last week with the first and second level of Section 2. We used the white board</p>
<h2>One Thing to Remember</h2>
<p>How to convert Decimal numbers to Binary numbers</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<h2>Actual</h2>
<p>The second day went really well, and we are making good progress on Lightbot.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Day 3</h1>
<h2>Procedures, Review Binary Number System</h2>
<p>We will review Binary Numbers, and practice converting</p>
<h2>Out of Desk</h2>
<h2>Hands-On/Coding</h2>
<p>We will finish up Lightbot, and our understanding of procedures.</p>
<h2>One Thing to Remember</h2>
<p>Procedures keep you DRY!</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<h2>Actual</h2>
<p>We are rocking! She has a great understanding of the Base 10, and Base 2 number systems. We started with going over those on the whiteboard, and filling in our place values. And finishing with converting decimal numbers to binary digits. She has really enjoyed Lightbot so we stayed on that, and got all the way to the end of the Unloading section, which should be Section 3. I'm sure she will want to finish the last level because she likes the challenge and we couldn't figure it out before class ended, but after that we will move onto Hopscotch because she is totally ready. And I think will really enjoy all the flexibility and creativity that it allows.</p>

<h1><a name="current">Day 4</a></h1>

<h2>Why Binary? Objects In Hopscotch</h2>
<p>Review the Binary Number system one last time, and make sure we have an understanding of how it is relevant to computer science. Move from Lightbot into the Hopscotch iPad app, start with talking about objects, and how they are programmable.</p>
<h2>Out of Desk</h2>
<p>Conduct a class exercise to physically demonstrate how a transistor works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select 3 kids, 1 transistor with its 3 connectors (base, collector, and emitter).</li>
<li>Arrange the collector, transistor, and emitter in a line and stand the base beside the transistor, perpendicular to the line.</li>
<li>Explain that the transistor can only have 1 tennis ball at a time and give her tennis ball to hold.</li>
<li>Give the collector several tennis balls and explain that she needs to get those balls to the emitter thro ugh the transistor — one ball at a time.</li>
<li>Explain that the transistor is “closed” because she is holding a tennis ball and therefore blocked.</li>
<li>So, the base can take away the tennis ball, which will allow the collector to pass balls to the emitter one ball at a time using the “free space” in the transistor.</li>
<li>The base can stop the flow, by giving the ball back to the transistor — shutting down the collector to emitter flow.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hands-On/Coding</h2>
<p>Our first task will be learning how we can arrange instructions to draw shapes with code. Students will start by saying the instructions for this little program out loud. We will then take a look at the various instructions or snippets of code that Hopscotches gives us to carry out this objective of drawing shapes with code.</p>
<h2>One Thing to Remember</h2>
<p>Programmable objects in Hopscotch</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>

<li>iPads</li>
<li>Reveal deck</li>
</ul>
