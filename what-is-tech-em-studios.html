        <p>Tech Em Studios offers classes and camps focused on applied computer science and computer-aided design at our studio in Short Pump and at local secondary schools. Our classes help students understand the exciting and evolving relationship of technology and creativity. So whether you want to learn about using technology for art, seriously prepare your child for an applied science and engineering program or get yourself up to speed on current device capabilities, we are building a range of curriculums to meet the needs of your family.</p>
<p>So, that is the marketing pitch. What about the story behind the creation of Tech Em? Well, we have three girls that are 5, 7, and 9 and I was concerned about their practical technology skills. It was 2013 after all and it seemed I had just as much opportunity to learn how to code and build my own circuits and rockets back in the 80's. Having been in "corporate" IT for almost 20 years, I had not kept up with technology education opportunities (or lack thereof) for secondary school students as well as adults outside the IT profession. That is how the idea for Tech Em starting brewing.</p>
<p>And we've become focused on the tech gap (and doing what we can to address the gap -- providing more tech education and experience). I'm referring to the gap growing between the demand for Programmers (people who can code) and people in the U.S. who can actually code. And so I've been developing curriculums that incorporate introductory Computer Science concepts in a very hands-on and applied way (designing, coding, testing, building). It actually all lines up very neatly with organizations like <a href="http://code.org">code.org</a>, the maker movement, all the open source hardware devices available and, of course, 3D printing.</p>
<p>Its turning out to be more than a new business venture, but a re-awakening of my inner geek since I get to re-learn and re-appreciate applied Computer Science to teach it. Furthermore, most of the kids I work with want to code and build more than use -- that actually isn't the problem. The challenge is sorting through all that is available to streamline kids' absorption of the key concepts so that they are learning how to think like a creative coder within the level-appropriate Engineering theory and discipline.</p>
<p>The name? Well, emersion is sort of a play on immersion, but is really the opposite of submersion. We'd like to think we are helping people rise up out of the sea of technology. Whether we are helping students keep from drowing in technology (devices) or we are training the next Engineers who are rising out of the sea of users to become builders and creators. Sounds pretty cool right, but also Tech Em just works better than Tech Im!</p>
