Summary: Some notes

### Quick notes from last night

The site I was using for the Minecraft setup on the pi is [here](http://picraftbukkit.webs.com/pi-minecraft-server-how-to).

I would suggest using your new SD card to setup minecraft. Once I go through that process, I will publish it here. You can always get started by going to raspberrypi.org and following the instructions to get the latest Raspian installed on your pi on the new SD card. That will actually take the most time -- getting the java version of minecraft running on that will be easy.

You can use the comments here on this site to ask questions and/or shoot me an email. You could even send me an email from your pi -- just don't send it every 5 minutes!!
