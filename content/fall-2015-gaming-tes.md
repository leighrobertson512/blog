Summary: Gaming ASE follow-up

Thanks again for letting Tech Em provide After School Enrichment for
your kids!

We worked primarily in two iOS-based apps for this class: Floors and
GamePress/Hyperpad.

### Floors
Floors is available for iOS (free) at [Pixel Press Floors](http://www.projectpixelpress.com).
Floors leverages "Design Thinking" -- we asked the kids
to think about the aspects of games that they like versus those that
they don't like. We actually played some games in the Floors arcade
for some comparisons before they started on their games. All students
have projects in the Floors arcade. I know some of them had better
names for there games, but in the spirit of anonymity while making
sure they can find their games, I published them in the arcade using
the techemstudios account naming them "TES-N" where N is their iPad
number (refer to your email).

### GamePress
Game Press is available on iOS (free) at [GamePress App](http://www.gamepressapp.com).
GamePress is a bit more technical and uses a behavior-oriented
strategy for creating games. This is similar to apps like Scratch, but
in GamePress, the options are much more complex and students can
adjust things like the physics-related aspects of characters and
enemies. If your student worked through a GamePress App, it will be on
their thumb drive. What you'll need to do is first install
GamePress app on your iOS device and either email the .tap
file on the thumb drive to your iOS device (iPad) or AirDrop the file
to your iOS device. Your device should give you the option to open up
the file in GamePress to play the game and/or continue editing it.

### More
Some of the students preferred Floors and kept working on
their games there and some moved on with GamePress. I would certainly encourage them to keep working (or create new games) with either app.

Please don't hesitate to comment here or email us if you have any
feedback or questions. We'd love to help these students continue
exploring software creation and learn more about Computer Science and
Software Engineering!
