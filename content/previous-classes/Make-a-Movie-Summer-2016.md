Summary: Make a Movie Summer Camp  

**That's a Wrap!!!**  

The campers really came together to make amazing movies using a variety of learned techniques!  

We started with a mini lesson on basic movie making.  

* **Our Movie Making General Outline**  
    + Brainstorming to Idea  
    + Idea to Script  
    + Script to Storyboard  
    + Storyboard to Film  
    + Film to Edit (to more film and edit)  
    + To Screening/Showing  

First, campers formed teams and started with brainstorming at least three movie ideas. From here, we continued the process with creating a script and storyboard. Using general premises of stories, they had a protagonist go on a journey of some sort and an antagonist to shake things up.  

After filming scenes from their storyboards, the editing process came into play. The "to more film and edit" holds true! More scenes were created and filmed, thus having more room for the editing process using iMovie, Garageband, and special effects apps, like ActionFX.
