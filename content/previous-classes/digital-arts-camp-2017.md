# Digital Arts  

## By Josef Seiler and Forest Kim  

## Future Entrepreneurs  

This week, campers were able to make up their own company and create logos for them.  First, they got to learn a little about graphic design through iOS apps such as Assembly.  With a little practice, off they went making excellent images for their companies!

## Define your Company  

* Company Logo  
  - Design a creative logo that draws people in
  - Bonus: create hidden images in your logo that displays the company's focus  

* 3D product design or 3D object that defines your company  
  - Once they were set on what their logo was, they got to transfer their idea to the 3D world and print them out in the real world!  

* Commercial  
  - Using videography and animation techniques learned in class
  - As another way to show off their companies, campers made commercials in order to advertise. Some used drawn animations and some used stop motion!

## Photography Scavenger Hunt  

We learned a few core photography techniques: centering objects, lining up your horizon, lighting, as well as digital imaging tricks. Students used these tips and tricks to conduct a photography scavenger hunt to capture the items below.  

*	A person (could be a whole person or someoneâ€™s hand/shoe etc.)  
*	Something in Nature (bird, plant, rock, bug, etc.)   
*	Food item  
*	Hardware (keyboard, mouse, monitor, iPad, tv, etc.)  
*	Colorful car  
*	Umbrella  
*	Tech Em Sign  
*	3D print   
*	Water bottle  
*	Book   

Campers were tasked with editing these images using the app, iPhoto Editor (or another app) and organizing these images together in a unique way.  

## Books Alive!  

Students took there favorite story or book, and made it into a movie! Some groups learned how to combine multiple animations to create a fluid movie, while others made stop-motion videos to retell the story of their favorite book.

The students at Digital Arts camp created impressive projects! Throughout the week, students presented some of their work to learn building from constructive feedback.  

You can find all of your child's projects including 3d files, movies, animations, and logo designs by logging into the Tech Em Studios site. Just navigate to Classes, then to Art & Technology Camp. Here, there is a compressed folder with the projects from camp.
