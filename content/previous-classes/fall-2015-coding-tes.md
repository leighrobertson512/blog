Summary: Gaming ASE follow-up

Thanks again for letting Tech Em provide After School Enrichment for
your kids!

We worked primarily using iOS-based apps for this class. The list of
those apps is provided below along with iOS alternatives where
appropriate:

### Lightbot
Students guide a robot around 3D blocks while learning key Coding
terms and concepts. I highly encourage you to get this app for your
student and encourage them to work through the levels and read the
instructions and guidelines as they go along -- we discussed many of
them throughout the course. Go to [lightbot.com](http://lightbot.com) for
more information and to get the app for Android or your desktop/laptop.

### Hopscotch
Building on some of the concepts learned in Lightbot while adding a
few more aspects of behavior-oriented programming,
[hopscotch](http://gethopscotch.com) is a terrific platform where kids truly
have fun creating their own apps and games while practicing their
coding techniques.

### Pythonista
We did a little bit of coding in a text-based language, called
[python](http://python.org). This coding language is used for education and
in the Software Engineering profession. Getting started here is a
great way to continue your student's education in Computer Science and
programming that will prepare them for High School courses.

### Floors
Floors is available for iOS (free) at [Pixel Press Floors](http://www.projectpixelpress.com).
Floors leverages "Design Thinking" -- we asked the kids
to think about the aspects of games that they like versus those that
they don't like. We actually played some games in the Floors arcade
for some comparisons before they started on their games. All students
have projects in the Floors arcade. I know some of them had better
names for there games, but in the spirit of anonymity while making
sure they can find their games, I published them in the arcade using
the techemstudios account naming them "TES-N" where N is their iPad
number (refer to your email).

Please don't hesitate to comment here or email us if you have any
feedback or questions. We'd love to help these students continue
exploring software creation and learn more about Computer Science and
Software Engineering!
