Summary: 3D Printing Camp Follow-up


### Summer 2015 3D Printing at the JCC
### By Wray Mills and Davis Mohar

Thank you so much for sending your kids/coming to our 3D printing camp
at the JCC. Please see the details below on what we did throughout the week and some pointers and links if you want to continue exploring the 3D printing world.

Also, please visit our main [site](http://techemstudios.com) for information on summer camps at our studio and our Computer Science and Programming courses. Our Fall schedule will be up next week!

### Where are the rest of the prints??
We are continuing to print some students' 3rd design and everyone's
4th design (most of the 4th designs were built in minecraft). We will
bring the prints back to the JCC and email everyone to let you all
know when they are ready. We appreciate your patience and the students know
that while the 3D printers are really cool, the current consumer and
small-business grade additive 3D printers are slow.

###Recap on what we did

 * Geometry lesson: 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D --
    On the first day we discussed some mathematical aspects of 3
    dimensions. They immediately started working with the 123D design
    app to create their first "free-form" design. The afternoon
    challenge was a self-portrait.
    
 * [123D Design](http://www.123dapp.com/design) --
   This app is actually free and is a great start for those just
   starting with CAD or the experienced designer. We use this app
   for a majority of our design work (the students spent a good deal
   of time using it this week). We encourage the use of "primitive" shapes and
   basic manipulations, but also allow them to use some of the
   "built-in" shapes and full examples from the gallery. The challenge
   for the second day was to design some type of vehicle.
    
 * [Print Shop by Makerbot](http://www.makerbot.com/printshop) --
   This app allowed the students to draw a picture on paper, take a
   picture, and "extrude" it into a 3D design. Most of the students
   used it to create rings and some of the other built-in design
   maniuplations. This provides a nice break from the more technical
   CAD-oriented 123D app.

* 3D printer pen --
   Throughout the week, the students were allowed to use the 3D
   printer pen to accentuate their designs or create separate designs.
   
 * Minecraft --
   As is the case for most camps for this age group, incorporating
   minecraft is a must. And actually, it works well for a 3D printing
   camp since the minecraft world is 3D. The campers worked on a
   structure in minecraft that we will be printing for them during the
   next week. So, the camp did turn into a minecraft camp the last day
   -- once we start with minecraft, its tough to pull the kids back
   into a more traditional design app. But, that's ok, we asked them
   to take turns explaining to the group how minecraft relates to a 3D design
   and printing class. The interesting thing is that most of the kids
   explained that building in minecraft requires creativitiy and a similar creative process used while creating designs in the 123D design app (its just more fun in minecraft).

 * Other technology and math educational apps --
	Because we spent many hours together, we let the students explore some of the other apps we have loaded on our iPads (and use for some of our other classes and camps). One of our popular apps that some tried out is [lightbot](http://blog.techemstudios.com/tablet-app-lightbot.html). Let me know if your kid tried out some other apps and I can give you some background and additional information.
	
 * Our printers --
	Some of you all had some questions about printers and buying one for home use. We use [Makerbot](http://makerbot.com) printers and I highly recommend the previous generation Replicator 2 and Replicator 2x; however, they may be hard to find now. You may even want to research Replicator clones. The newer generation of Replicators with their "smart extruders" have actually proven to be less reliable and "less smart". There is actually a class action lawsuit being filed against Makerbot and their smart extruder technology. As is the case with most emerging technologies, it may be a few more years before a clear leader emerges with reliable products at a good price. And finally, a wonderful place to go and look and all that is being designed for 3D printing is [thingiverse](http://thingiverse.com). You'll be amazed at all the great designs people have uploaded to share with the world.


Thanks again and Happy printing!
