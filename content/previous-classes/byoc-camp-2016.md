Summary: Follow up on BYOC camp

To start off the week, the campers learned about how a computer works and the function of each part of the computer. We went over the processor, motherboard, RAM, power supply, solid state drives, and disk drive. Over the first two days, we installed all the parts, and wired everything up. Once the computer was built, they installed Windows 10 onto their computers as well as a variety of other programs such as antimalware, runtimes, and drivers. We then went over computer secuirty and how to best keep themselves and their computers safe from viruses, malware, or phishing. We also discussed troubleshooting steps for both hardware and software issuses so that they will be able to fix any problems that could arise in the future.
