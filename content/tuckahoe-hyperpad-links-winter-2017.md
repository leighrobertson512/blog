For more on what we learned about the design process to create these games and Hyperpad, visit our blog on [Design Thinking](http://blog.techemstudios.com/design-thinking-outline.html) and a blog from last year's [Game Design summer camp](http://blog.techemstudios.com/design-thinking-and-gaming-camp.html). We learned this process specifically for creating games, but it is widely used for design, in general. Have a great rest of the school year!
