Summary: Notes on gamepress downloads

You can access your [GamePress](http://www.gamepressapp.com) app by logging into TechEm's [secure site](https://secure.techemstudios.com). There is an enrollment record for every class, course, or camp you take at TechEm. So, go to the record for the gaming camp and there will be a zipfile that contains the GamePress app(s) you created during the camp.

So, all you need to do is transfer the game files to your iPad and open up in GamePress. Once you have GamePress installed, one easy way to do this is email yourself the file (using an email address you can access on the iPad). When you choose the attachment on the iPad, you will have the option to "open in" GamePress. Do that and you can edit and/or play your game!!

And contact us if you have any issues or questions!

Happy gaming.
