### List of Downloadable Links for Created Games    

Everyone did a great job designing their games! Below is a list of links for each student from the Game Design class at Robious Elementary School from this Winter's session. A total of 15 designed games! Presently, Hyperpad is only available on an iPad and it is free.  

These links are only available for seven days, starting today. So, be sure to check out the game links as soon as you can! Feel free to email joe@techemstudios.com if the link has expired.

For more on what we learned about the design process to create these games and Hyperpad, visit our blog on [Design Thinking](http://blog.techemstudios.com/design-thinking-outline.html) and a blog from last year's [Game Design summer camp](http://blog.techemstudios.com/design-thinking-and-gaming-camp.html). We learned this process specifically for creating games, but it is widely used for design, in general. Have a great rest of the school year!
