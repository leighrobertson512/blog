# Minecraft 3D Camp

### Can we build it?

At the beginning of the camp, students got their hands on their iPads and immediately started with a competitive build challenge.

Students continued to compete in build challenges throughout the week, one of the most notable was the redstone camp, where some campers worked together to create their own redstone contraptions

# Robotics  

### Bombini Bot, GO!

The camp began with students taking their new Bombini Bots out of their boxes and examining their Arduinos. Upon receiving their new hardware, students needed to piece their robots together

After constructing their robots, the students quickly learned how to use Scratch and Arduino to program their Robots to move around the studio and complete various tasks.

To finish off the camp, campers needed to run their robots through a gauntlet of tests and eventually faced off in a hockey match!
