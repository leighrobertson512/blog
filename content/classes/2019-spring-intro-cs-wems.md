Summary: WEMS Intro to CS
Status: draft

# Description

Students will learn about the history of computing and computer science; they will review the evolving machines and the people behind them. Students will be introduced to the binary building blocks of modern computers: the binary number system, logic gates, and elementary boolean logic. They will learn about computer programming, "coding", and explore the basic concepts through: visual languages, coding games and a text-based language.

## More Logic Gates

Class will start with going over the Logic Gates we talked about two weeks ago on the whiteboard and having the students will in the Truth Table or Table of Truth as I like to call it.

## Out of Desk

Conduct a class exercise to physically demonstrate how a transistor works:

- Select 3 kids, 1 transistor with its 3 connectors (base, collector, and emitter).
- Arrange the collector, transistor, and emitter in a line and stand the base beside the transistor, perpendicular to the line.
- Explain that the transistor can only have 1 tennis ball at a time and give her tennis ball to hold.
- Give the collector several tennis balls and explain that she needs to get those balls to the emitter through the transistor — one ball at a time.
- Explain that the transistor is “closed” because she is holding a tennis ball and therefore blocked.
- So, the base can take away the tennis ball, which will allow the collector to pass balls to the emitter one ball at a time using the “free space” in the transistor.
- The base can stop the flow, by giving the ball back to the transistor — shutting down the collector to emitter flow.

## Hands-On/coding

The kids will be asked to draw the different kinds of logic gates we have talked about on the mini qhiteboards. Once they have completed that, they should use an iPad with the app Circuitry to create the logic gates in the app.

## One thing to remember

- AND, OR, NOT gate
- How many inputs?
- How many outputs?
- Truth table values

## Setup

- iPads
- Whiteboard
- Tennis balls
- Logic Card flash cards

## Actual
