## It depends! -- Conditional Statements
We'll discuss conditional statements in computer programs.

![If only.](images/if2.jpg)

## Out of Desk
Raise your hand, IF you are wearing a coat. Simple "boolean" condition.
Touch your nose, WHEN you need help. Simple "state" condition.
Raise your hand IF you are wearing a coat ELSE touch your nose.

[//]: # (For this activity we will ask the class questions that begin with the word IF, and relate it to an article of clothing, and ask if them to raise their hands if the IF statement is true for them. *"If you are wearing a jacket, raise your hand"* *"If you are wearing shoes, and a hat... raise your hand"*)


## Hands-On/coding
We will spend time continuing our Crossy Road games, and adding one of
the last steps that involves a type of event called a collision. In
HopScotch, this is illustrated with the conditional Rule "When Bumps"
allowing us to CONDITIONALLY CONTROL what happens WHEN our character bumps into an enemy.

## One thing to remember
What is a conditional statement? It depends!
