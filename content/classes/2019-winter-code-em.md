Summary: Studio Code Em Class

# Description

12-week Session
Tuesdays, February 5 - April 30, 6:30-7:30pm
(no class April 2)

Students will gain or expand their coding knowledge through a variety of programming languages and projects based on experience level, building from visual-based languages to Python. They will apply practical computer science skills such as source code control, software design, reverse engineering, bug resolution, and coding environments.

# Pre-Requisites
The Padawan section requires previous Code Em experience including these concepts:
 * Binary Number System
 * Boolean Logic
 * Python programming: conditionals, loops, functions and Classes
 * Introduction to Git
 * Introduction to Linux
 * Device Engineering
 
This class will require 2+ hours of time outside the class. Several sessions will be flipped -- students will be given an assignment to review online (lecture) materials before the next class so that we can spend the time in class actually applying the concepts correctly.

# Learning Objectives

 * GitHub account and understand basic GitHub concepts of clone, pull, commit and push.
 * Can create and run a Python program on their own.
 * Understand design thinking and how to apply to planning software.
 * Know how to examine simple programs to understand how they work and how to alter.
 * Know how to deal with runtime errors and how to resolve.
 * Know the different tools needed for coding -- editors, interpreters and execution (runtime).
 * Create CLI program(s).
 * Know how to branch and PR in GitHub.
 * Complete an appropriate level assignment.
 * Work in Cloud9
 * Work in Jupyter notebooks

## One Thing to Remember
Writing code that other humans can understand is pretty much the point of programming languages.

## Setup
Cloud9 environments.
