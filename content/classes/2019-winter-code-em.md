## Setup

_Detail an class/classroom prep needed for this day or lesson. For example, chromebooks with crouton or Cloud9 provisioned/AWS IAM created._

- Chromebooks, ChromeOS side
- Cloud9 accounts created just in case, but won't get too until WEEK 2
- Tech Em Github accounts for students without emails

## Plan

**Class Topic: Version Control and Collaboration**

The kids will be introduced to version control, and walked through the process of setting up a Github account. We will also talk about ways to get help when working from home, and get everyone set up in the class Slack channel.

**Hands-On/Coding: Chromebooks**

All the students will be allowed to use one of our Chromebooks while at the studio during the session. They will be able to log into any of their accounts, as well as doing all the programming exercises. We will be making sure everyone can access their Github account, and Slack account.

**Out of Desk Activity: Icebreaker**

At the start of class to get things warmed up we will go around the room and say our name, what we enjoy about computers, and what we want to learn in this class. We will then hand out Chromebooks, and go over the operating procedure.

**One Thing Students Should Remember: Their account information**

Students should get in the habit of logging into their accounts that are required for class. And be able to briefly describe what each tool is being used for in class. They should be able to access their email as well in case they need to reset their password.
