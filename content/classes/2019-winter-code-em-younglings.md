# Day 1

## Intro to Computer Science

History of Computer Science, and Computers. Talking about the progress we have made in the last couple decades, and ending with the transistor. 


## Out of Desk

We will go over Lightbot first on the whiteboard, and then we will act out how it works by having one person play the programmer, and one person play the robot. The programmer will have to program the "human robot" with instructions in order to get it to move certain area of the room. We will see how putting these instructions in the correct order is crucial, we will also mention the concept of efficency, and how we can work to make our programs more effecient. 

## Hands On

Kids will start with using the iPads along with an app called Lightbot. There they have to program a robot using the instructions that Lightbot provides. The first section of Lightbot focuses on sequences, and putting groups of instructions into code blocks, preparing us for procedures. 

## One Thing to Remember

Instructions, and sequences. The students should be famialiar, and comfortable organizing instructions into the correct order to produce the outcome that they want. Lightbot gives us the chance to do this by manavuering out robot through the obstacle course until he has completed everything. 

## Setup

## Actual

We started off with the reveal deck, and went through the history of computers ending our discussion with transistors, and taking a look at the vacuum tubes. We talked a bit about computer programming, and went over Lightbot using the white board.

# Day 2 - Base 2, and Binary Number System

## Code Em

We reviewed the history of computers, and talked about vacuum tubes, and transistors. Next we introduced how the Binary Number system relates to all this, and computer science. 

## Out of Desk

We will start with going over the Base 10 number system which we are familar with, and know as decimal. Then we will introduce what computers use to speak which is known as the Base 2 system, or the Binary number system. Using the white board we will go through converting 1-10 in decimal to binary and make sure we have a solid understanding of it. 

## Hands On/Coding
We will continue our progress with Lightbot. We ended last week with the first and second level of Section 2. We used the white board 


## One Thing to Remember

How to convert Decimal numbers to Binary numbers


## Setup

## Actual

The second day went really well, and we are making good progress on Lightbot.

# Day 3 - Procedures, Review Binary Number System

We will review Binary Numbers, and practice converting

## Out of Desk

## Hands-On/Coding

We will finish up Lightbot, and our understanding of procedures. 


## One Thing to Remember

What the point of using procedures is, and how they help us improve our efficiency

## Setup

## Actual

We are rocking! She has a great understanding of the Base 10, and Base 2 number systems. We started with going over those on the whiteboard, and filling in our place values. And finishing with converting decimal numbers to binary digits. She has really enjoyed Lightbot so we stayed on that, and got all the way to the end of the Unloading section, which should be Section 3. I'm sure she will want to finish the last level because she likes the challenge and we couldn't figure it out before class ended, but after that we will move onto Hopscotch because she is totally ready. And I think will really enjoy all the flexiable and creativity that it allows.
