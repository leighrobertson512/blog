# Day 1

## Intro to Computer Science

History of Computer Science, and Computers. Talking about the progress we have made in the last couple decades, and ending with the transistor.

## Out of Desk

We will go over Lightbot first on the whiteboard, and then we will act out how it works by having one person play the programmer, and one person play the robot. The programmer will have to program the "human robot" with instructions in order to get it to move certain area of the room. We will see how putting these instructions in the correct order is crucial, we will also mention the concept of efficiency, and how we can work to make our programs more efficient.

[//]: #(We need to be very precise when we talk about efficiency. I believe in your case your are referring to improving the act of writing code and not the runtime of the program. In Computer Science, efficiency is typically either referring to the overall input vs. output (overall software development system productivity -- including creation, testing and maintainability) or the run-time efficiency of a program or system. In fact, the latter is typically what is discussed in a class where individual developers are writing programs. So, your context of discussion at this point should reiterate the lecture about Ada Lovelace and the concepts around writing code that is not just easier _for other humans_ to read, but also maintain. If you repeat the same code over and over again, instead of using a procedue, when you make a change to that logic, you need to change it x number of times instead of once. So, that makes the debugging and maintenance of the code more efficient but not the program itself. Don't confuse a Day1 CS class with the term efficiency unless you are speaking to the high level objectives of an Engineer -- your statements here and perhaps your implied instruction to the student that using procedures will make your program faster are not correct.)

## Hands On

Kids will start with using the iPads along with an app called Lightbot. There they have to program a robot using the instructions that Lightbot provides. The first section of Lightbot focuses on sequences, and putting groups of instructions into code blocks, preparing us for procedures.

## One Thing to Remember

Instructions and sequences. The students should be familiar, and comfortable organizing instructions into the correct order to produce the outcome that they want. Lightbot gives us the chance to do this by maneuvering out robot through the obstacle course until he has completed everything.

## Setup

## Actual

We started off with the reveal deck, and went through the history of computers ending our discussion with transistors, and taking a look at the vacuum tubes. We talked a bit about computer programming, and went over Lightbot using the white board.

# Day 2

## Base 10 and Base 2 Number Systems

We reviewed the history of computers, and talked about vacuum tubes, and transistors. Next we introduced how the Binary Number system relates to all this, and computer science.

## Out of Desk

We will start with going over the Base 10 number system which we are familiar with, and know as decimal. Then we will introduce what computers use to speak which is known as the Base 2 system, or the Binary number system. Using the white board we will go through converting 1-10 in decimal to binary and make sure we have a solid understanding of it.

## Hands On/Coding

We will continue our progress with Lightbot. We ended last week with the first and second level of Section 2. We used the white board

## One Thing to Remember

How to convert Decimal numbers to Binary numbers

## Setup

## Actual

The second day went really well, and we are making good progress on Lightbot.

# Day 3

## Procedures, Review Binary Number System

We will review Binary Numbers, and practice converting

## Out of Desk

## Hands-On/Coding

We will finish up Lightbot, and our understanding of procedures.

## One Thing to Remember

Procedures keep you DRY!

## Setup

## Actual

We are rocking! She has a great understanding of the Base 10, and Base 2 number systems. We started with going over those on the whiteboard, and filling in our place values. And finishing with converting decimal numbers to binary digits. She has really enjoyed Lightbot so we stayed on that, and got all the way to the end of the Unloading section, which should be Section 3. I'm sure she will want to finish the last level because she likes the challenge and we couldn't figure it out before class ended, but after that we will move onto Hopscotch because she is totally ready. And I think will really enjoy all the flexibility and creativity that it allows.

## Why Binary? Objects In Hopscotch

Review the Binary Number system one last time, and make sure we have an understanding of how it is relevant to computer science. Move from Lightbot into the Hopscotch iPad app, start with talking about objects, and how they are programmable.

## Out of Desk

Conduct a class exercise to physically demonstrate how a transistor works:

- Select 3 kids, 1 transistor with its 3 connectors (base, collector, and emitter).
- Arrange the collector, transistor, and emitter in a line and stand the base beside the transistor, perpendicular to the line.
- Explain that the transistor can only have 1 tennis ball at a time and give her tennis ball to hold.
- Give the collector several tennis balls and explain that she needs to get those balls to the emitter thro ugh the transistor — one ball at a time.
- Explain that the transistor is “closed” because she is holding a tennis ball and therefore blocked.
- So, the base can take away the tennis ball, which will allow the collector to pass balls to the emitter one ball at a time using the “free space” in the transistor.
- The base can stop the flow, by giving the ball back to the transistor — shutting down the collector to emitter flow.

## Hands-On/Coding

Our first task will be learning how we can arrange instructions to draw shapes with code. Students will start by saying the instructions for this little program out loud. We will then take a look at the various instructions or snippets of code that Hopscotches gives us to carry out this objective of drawing shapes with code.
