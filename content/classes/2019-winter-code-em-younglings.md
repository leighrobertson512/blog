## Intro to Computer Science



## Out of Desk

## Hands On

Kids will start with using the iPads along with an app called Lightbot. There they have to program a robot using the instructions that Lightbot provides. The first section of Lightbot focuses on sequences, and putting groups of instructions into code blocks, preparing us for procedures. 

## One Thing to Remember

Instructions, and sequences. The students should be famialiar, and comfortable organizing instructions into the correct order to produce the outcome that they want. Lightbot gives us the chance to do this by manavuering out robot through the obstacle course until he has completed everything. 

## Setup

## Actual

We started off with the powerpoint, and went through the history of computers ending our discussion with transistors, and taking a look at the vacuum tubes. We talked a bit about computer programming, and went over Lightbot using the white board.
