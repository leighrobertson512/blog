## Description

Camp Session
August 12 - 15, 9 - 12pm

Students will learn about Amazon Alexa, and how she works. Throughout
the week we will explore how to develop "skills," which are ways that
we can teach Alexa to do new things through different computer
languages. Campers at the end of the week will have completed their
first Alexa skill, and can publish it to the Amazon store!
