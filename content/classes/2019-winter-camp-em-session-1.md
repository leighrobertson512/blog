# Jump to [Current Lesson](#day-3)

# Description
We will take two of our favorite things, 3D Printing + Minecraft, and learn how we can take our designs from pixels to plastic! Students will use laptops to design, and create something in their Minecraft worlds. After we will export that to a special piece of software that allows us to create a type of file that the 3D printer can read. Weather you want to make a huge castle with a mout, or replicate a famous statue, there is no limit to what you can create. If you can build it, we can print it.

## Out of Desk

We will take a look over the 3D printer, and learn about it's different parts. The kids will all take turns unloading and loading the filament, also learn what to do if the 3D printer gets jammed.

## Hands-On/coding
Today will be the day we learn about the process of exporting, importing, and then exporting again! In order for us to make this all work, we need to go through a process of converting our creation into a format that the 3D printer understands. Since we have a Makerbot 3D printer, we will be using their desktop software to prepare our prints.
