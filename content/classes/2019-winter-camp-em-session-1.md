# Jump to [Current Lesson](#day-3)

# Description
We will take two of our favorite things, 3D Printing + Minecraft, and learn how we can take our designs from pixels to plastic! Students will use laptops to design, and create something in their Minecraft worlds. After we will export that to a special piece of software that allows us to create a type of file that the 3D printer can read. Weather you want to make a huge castle with a mout, or replicate a famous statue, there is no limit to what you can create. If you can build it, we can print it.

## Minecraft 3D Printing & Design

Our focus for Day 1 will be on the 3D printing side mostly, and how everything works. We will start with our 3D Printing slide show, that gives us a brief overview of the third diminsion and what that means. After we will spend some time looking at two different iPad apps, Makerbot App, 123D Design.

## Out of Desk
The kids will have a chance to examine the 3D printers, and get an understanding of how they operate. And we will start a print so we can see all the moving parts.

## Hands-On/coding

Our hands on activity will start with using the iPads and a couple different 3D design applications. We will use the Makerbot iPad software to create different types of customizable prebuilt items. After getting a grasp on that, we will move to 123D Design and start working with the primitive shapes, and our imaginations to design something from scratch!

## One thing to remember



## Setup

## Actual

The kids enjoyed the slide show, especially the part about the 3D printer that prints with chocolate instead of plastics. We also took a look at both of the printers, and started a print so we could all see it in action. The MakerBot App was a lot of fun, I think they liked the bracelets the most, but they also made some really cool medals. I think it can be a little overwhelming starting with a blank slate, but we had some fun in 123D Design using different shapes, and learning how we could snap them together.

We will take a look over the 3D printer, and learn about it's different parts. The kids will all take turns unloading and loading the filament, also learn what to do if the 3D printer gets jammed.

## Hands-On/coding
Today will be the day we learn about the process of exporting, importing, and then exporting again! In order for us to make this all work, we need to go through a process of converting our creation into a format that the 3D printer understands. Since we have a Makerbot 3D printer, we will be using their desktop software to prepare our prints.
