Summary: WEMS Coding

# Jump to [Current Lesson](#day-6)

# Description
Students will gain or expand their coding knowledge through a variety of programming languages and projects based on experience level, building from visual-based languages to Python. They will apply practical computer science skills such as source code control, software design, reverse engineering, bug resolution, and coding environments.

## GitHub - your online portfolio
We'll discuss GitHub, what it is and create an account.

The students will setup their GitHub account. We'll cover how GitHub is also a public/social place and therefore our "Internet Safety" rules apply to GitHub as well. Also, because GitHub can become a digital portfolio that is used by future schools and employers during an application process, it is actually even more important to maintain a serious presence on GitHub since it is a real-time personal resume.

## Out of Desk
Using physical paper and file folders, our class activity will be a real-world analogy for GitHub. GitHub maintains all versions of the document (or code) you are editing -- for the activity the "GitHub" person will hold on to many file folders (a *repository*), each one representing previous versions with the one on top being the most recent.

When a student wants to edit the latest, she requests the latest from "GitHub", who will actually present a COPY of the latest for the student to edit.

She takes the paper from the folder and makes some edits.

She puts the paper back in the folder, *committing* those changes to her copy of the folder.

She then hands the folder back to "GitHub", *pushing* those changes so that they can be included in the latest version of the folder.


## Hands-On/coding
Using a prepared GitHub repository, students will use the GitHub web editor to make changes to a website. Since GitHub also supports the publishing of websites, the students can immediately make see their changes on a live website. Their take-away from this class is a live website they can edit!

## One thing to remember
GitHub is your online Digital Portfolio.

## Setup
Create a repo with gh-pages turned on (pointing to /docs). Add a simple HTML/CSS website for the students to edit. We can go ahead and use a custom domain like wems.techemstudios.com to make it easier for the students/parents to access.
