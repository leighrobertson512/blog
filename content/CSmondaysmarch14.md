Summary: Elementary Computer Science

#**Intro to Elementary Computer Science**  
##What we went over: Variables/values
#In terms of math, we defined a variable to be a quantity that is able to assume different numerical values.Variables store values so we can use them multiple times.
***
#What apps we used in class: **Hopscotch**
***
#Exercise we completed in Hopscotch:
#To explore how to use values within variables, we programmed our character, a text object (your name) to make a square using a loop (from our first Hopscotch challenge last week). 
  
#We assigned a value (which is constant, this way we can use it more than once) as "X", some of you chose your name or other word for the value. 
  
#We set our value to display a number, "1." 
  
#We then used the value we created to set our text object as that value ("X"). Our text object was now displaying the number 1 as it performed the sequence of instructions to make a square.
  
#To have our value continuously count up, we input 'Increase value' to be a part of our square instructions. We set it to increase our value "X" by 1.
  
#Now, when we played our square instructions, each time your object turned to make the corner of the square, that number value increased by 1!
  
#If you had your loop repeat 100 times or forever (endless loop), the object would increase its value by 1 until it reached 100 or it would keep counting up to infinity!

#Terms:  
##**A Variable** a quantity that is able to assume different numerical values.
##**Value** remains constant.
##**Loop** a sequence of instructions that is repeated until it recieves the order to stop.

#Next class we will recap on logic gates and learn how we can combine them to form adders!

#See you next class, March 21st!
