Summary: Some of the student design LEDs

As part of the Homeschool courses and an Elementary enrichment course, we ended up making 23 LED-faced robots. That means there are 23 #rva kids who came up with their own set of LED "frames" design, coded it, and programmed their bot's microcontroller. Here are pics of some of some early prototypes followed by finished projects.
