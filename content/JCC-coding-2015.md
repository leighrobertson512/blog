Summary: JCC Coding Camp Follow-up


### Summer 2015 JCC Coding Camp Recap

Thank you so much for sending your kids to our Coding Camp at the JCC
this summer! We've include a brief recap of the different apps we used
that allowed us to present basic to intermediate concepts of
coding. Along with our hands on experience, we had a chance to present
some computer science history and general computing concepts.  

So, please visit our main [site](http://techemstudios.com) for
information on continuing your child's education in Computer Science
and Programming. Our
[Fall classes](http://techemstudios.com/all-classes.html)  start the week of September 14th.


### Recap on the apps we used

 * [Lightbot](http://blog.techemstudios.com/tablet-app-lightbot.html)

 * [Hopscotch](https://www.gethopscotch.com) -- Similar to MIT's
   scratch programming system for kids,
   Hopscotch provides a visual programming environment that takes
   advantage of tablet capabilities.

 * Gamepress App, which is now [Hyperpad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id886106438) -- This app provides a
   more advanced visual, event-oriented app that is optimized for
   building classic arcade-style games.
    
 * The [python programming language](http://python.org) (text-based language) using
 [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/).

 * A sample of our mad libs code for pythonista
