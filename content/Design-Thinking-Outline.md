**Outline for the Design Thinking Process Used in Tech Em'S Game Design Classes and Camps.** 

Design thinking is a user-centered approach to solving everyday problems.  This a rough outline of the design thinking process followed during the Game Design classes and camps:

* **Observation**    
    + What are your favorite games to play?
    + Why are they your favorite games?  

***  
  
  
* **Brainstorming** (*from design thinking questions sheet*)  
    + What makes your favorite games fun to play? [what makes these games fun?]  
    + What would you include in your game?  
    + What would you leave out for your game?  

***  
    
From the answers to these questions above, guidelines are now set for the design of the game. Moreover, from these guidelines, come the various challenges of finding out how to design our game using these guidelines. We start by figuring out multiple solutions to use while creating the game.     
      
    
***  

* **Protoyping**    
    + Create your game!  
    + Keep in mind the brainstorming topics and design thinking questions  


***  
    
* **Implementation**    
    + Test your game  
        - what do you like?  
        - what could you change?  
        - what's missing? what could you add?  
          
    + Collaborate  
        - have someone else play your game - vice versa  
        - get feedback/provide feedback  
        - from the feedback, we conjure up more solutions to implement in the design.  
        - repeat the process!

Below is a rough diagram of the overall design process scheme:

The green arrows represent the conintuous iteration of the whole process.  

We used this process to make awesome games!
