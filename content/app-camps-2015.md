Summary: App Camp Follow-up

### Summer 2015 App Camps

For many of the students in app camp this summer, we actually used apps to create apps. This is a nice way to get kids used to some of the basic concepts required to program (code) and ultimately build mobile applications. We jumped around using some of the best learning/app/game creation apps available. And all of them got an introduction to some text-based coding (Python) for some quick learning and exposure to programming language concepts.

### Apps Used

 * [Lightbot](http://blog.techemstudios.com/tablet-app-lightbot.html)

 * [Hopscotch](https://www.gethopscotch.com) -- Similar to MIT's
   scratch programming system for kids,
   Hopscotch provides a visual programming environment that takes
   advantage of tablet capabilities.

 * Gamepress App, which is now [Hyperpad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id886106438) -- This app provides a
   more advanced visual, event-oriented system that is optimized for
   building classic arcade-style games.

Please note that Gamepress is
   no longer available on the app store. The good news is that your GamePress game will open in
   Hyperpad. The bad news is that many of the GamePress graphics
   (sprites) do not convert. Custom graphics convert and you can
   create your own graphics to replace those that did not
   convert. Please, feel free to contact us if you have any issues or
   questions pertaining to the GamePress -> Hyperpad conversions. This
   has actually been a good learning experience for our student
   app/game developers because they see how designing and creating
   graphics is just as time consuming and important as the actual game
   play logic and coding.
    
 * The [python programming language](http://python.org) (text-based language) using
 [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/).
