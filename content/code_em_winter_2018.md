## Day One  

### Happy New Year!  

`01/09/2018`  

During this winter session of Code Em we will learn by doing! We will learn new concepts and solidify concepts we have come across before by taking a project-based approach during the twelve weeks. To name a few, project topics can include (not limited to): device building and programming with the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), robot creations, 3D printing, [Pi Soundboard](http://blog.techemstudios.com/how-to-make-a-raspberry-pi-soundboard.html), Python game design with [Pygame](http://pygame.org/news), web applications, ethical hacking with Pi Zero or [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/), Minecraft Modding with Java, Alexa skills, [PiLexa](http://blog.techemstudios.com/make-a-raspberry-pi-powered-alexa.html) and visual-based programming projects like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and [Hopsctoch](https://www.gethopscotch.com/).  

The goal is to have one or several awesome projects by the end of our twelve weeks together. After completing projects, we will make sure we are comfortable enough with the stuff we learn to continue beyond the class.  

Whether we work in groups or individually during the weeks, we will always work with someone, i.e. instructors/mentors. To ensure this, we will use two key resources for help and teamwork: [Slack](http://blog.techemstudios.com/slack.html) & [GitHub](https://github.com/); both great tools for team collaboration. Slack is a messaging app and GitHub will serve as a place to save and keep track of all project work. We will use Slack to ask questions and collaborate on projects. We will use GitHub to save all our work to, keep track of projects, as well as help one another to solve any issues. **You will need an accesible email account.** Which bring us to our first assignment!  

### Assignment 1  
Create a new account for [Slack](https://slack.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) --you will need to verify the email address you sign up with for both. Don't forget your usernames and passwords! Once you have your own Slack and GitHub account, email your usernames to class-info@techemstudios.com, so we can add you to the class' Slack team. For those that already have both accounts, just make sure you can log into them!  

Next week, we will narrow down project ideas and get our hands dirty.
