# Hi. I'm Matthew
a.k.a. `sirtomato`, `sirtomato999`, or sometimes `cherry tomato`   
I like to write code in Python, and I sometime wish to learn something like nodejs.  

## Projects

I have made a few things include a [Fantasy Football Draft Helper](https://github.com/sirtomato999/drafty). And, uh, well, thats about it. I currently, though, am working on a simple OpenGL Python engine. That is not on the interwebz yet.
