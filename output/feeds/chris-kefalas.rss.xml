&lt;p&gt;Slack has come onto the scene in the last couple years as a way for groups of people to communicate, in a chat room like setting. What makes Slack stand out from similar pieces of software is it's ease of use, and simplicity. At Tech 'Em Studios we use Slack to talk amongst each other, and share ideas. The real fun with Slack comes when you
dive into all of it's features, and the many different types of textual bots you can have feeding your Slack channel with information.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal with using Slack with the students is firstly to be able to allow them to ask questions to the instructors when they aren't in class. But also as part of an activity
that involves using the Python programming language to create, and program your own Slack bot! With the knowledge that the students learn from class they will be able to commit changes to the class bot, and make it talk back depending on what is said to it. We like this activity because it's fun, as well as gets the kids thinking about artificial intelligence! My plan for this blog post is to talk about getting signed up, joining Slack, and bit more about it features.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Signing up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get signed up with the Tech 'Em Student's Slack channel you will need to provide us with your  email either in class, or by sending us an email at &lt;a href="mailto:info@techemstudios.com"&gt;info@techemstudios.com&lt;/a&gt;. If your child doesn't have an email, I suggest creating one via Gmail, or having them use yours. Email is simply needed to sign up for Slack, and as a method of resetting, or recovering your password.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Email Inbox" src="images/slack-gmail2.jpg" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will receive the invitation in your inbox. By click the big green button you will start the registration process. Things that has been &lt;strong&gt;underlined in red&lt;/strong&gt; is the identifying parts for you to be able to verify you have received the correct invitation, and your child will be joining a Slack channel controlled, and administered by Tech 'Em Studios.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note&lt;/strong&gt;, you will be invited by either Joe Seiler, Chris Kefalas, or Wray Mills. If one of those names isn't listed, you know someones 'a phishing!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Email" src="images/slack-invite3.jpg" /&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about getting signed up, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at &lt;a href="mailto:info@techemstudios.com"&gt;info@techemstudios.com&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Joining Slack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you have click the big green button you will be prompted to type in your name, and choose a username. This user name can be anything, granted it is appropriate, and within Slack's guidelines for user name creation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="create" src="images/slack-create1.jpg" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will than be prompted to create a password for your account. We always recommend using a Great password!    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="password" src="images/slack-password4.jpg" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next screen you will see will look like the one below. It will offer to walk you through a tutorial of how Slack works, and is set up. It's super quick and gives you a basic idea of the layout.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="tutorial" src="images/slack-tut6.jpg" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Slacking?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack is set up as a system of chat rooms known as channels that are always prefixed with a octothorpe (#). Everyone is automatically joined into the channel known as #general. Currently we have configured Slack so that all our students are in #general, and can read, and write. The purpose of #general is for dialogue between everyone, as well as relaying the latest messages from Tech 'Em Studio headquarters! From there we have created private channels named after each class that only the particular students in that class can join. The goal with the private channels is to allow each class to interact with their bot, as well as let them talk amongst themselves. We hope that by creating these class channels the students will be able to better interact with other students, and help each other out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Slack" src="images/slack-slack-5.jpg" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The channels you see on the side will be different depending on what class the student is in. Everyone though is automatically joined into #general, and #random, and their respective class channels as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students can also create private messages with other students that are part of the Slack channel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. As well as Android, iOS, and you can even use Slack in a web browser by navigating to https://techemstudents.slack.com.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Slack bot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as much as the Slack craze has been sweeping the nation, the Slack &lt;em&gt;bot&lt;/em&gt; craze has been steadily gaining traction. A Slack bot is a textual bot that can be programmed to provide a certain function. People have created hundreds of these bots to do anything you can think of! Taco Bell even has one called &lt;a href="https://www.tacobell.com/feed/tacobot"&gt;Taco Bot&lt;/a&gt; that lets you order tacos straight from Slack!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main ones you will see hanging out in our channel are Twitter bot, Github bot, Travis bot, and our work in progress #general Python bot. Some bots you can interact with via typing in certain commands. Other bots will just feed information into your channel based on certain circumstances. For instance, whenever we post a tweet to our Twitter account, it will relay that message into the Slack channel for everyone to see. In a similar manner, the Github bot will post a message whenever someone has made a new commit to the repo!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students will be working with the Python programming language to create their own Slack bots! Either for their own use, and experimentations, or as a general bot to hang out in their class channel. They will than be able to program that bot to respond to certain commands with just text, or make a query to a certain data set online. It really is a lot of fun, and the possibilities are endless when thinking of different ways you can interact with the bot.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These bots can either be ran on a Raspberry Pi, your PC, or even in the cloud! Slack is a free service up until a certain amount of users. So at the end of the session, students can create their own Slack channels, and start crafting their own bots to hang out in their channels!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack is awesome, and personally is the only thing I can see replacing e-mail one day. We are hoping that by using Slack, and allowing students to communicate amongst themselves, as well as with teachers outside of the classroom will really help to make all of the classes feel more seamless. Slack is a great way to open the discussion about problems students are having with assignments, and for teachers to provide live help to walk them through issues that might arise. A lot of our classes we only get to spend one hour a week with the students. But with Slack it extends that, and allows them to reach out for help anytime during the week!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us know if you have any questions by emailing us at &lt;a href="info@techemstudios.com"&gt;info@techemstudios.com&lt;/a&gt; please.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;9/14/2016&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Intro to Raspberry Pi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create Em started out with discussions on objectives, or desired projects. Since the Raspberry Pi is so versatile, allows for easy manipulation, and provides a mecca for machine learning, we will be completing a slew of projects with this device.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi is essentially a mini computer (pocket-sized). It is a device for non-experienced and experienced programmers alike. By working through projects associated with the pi, its user can learn programming in a hands-on/interactive way. The pi's introduction started with an activity on all of its parts that come with it and what those parts do. For this class we are using the Raspberry Pi 3 model B. The pi is a single board computer with all the components on one board. The point was made that these components are very similar to traditional computers and cell phones, just on a smaller scale.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Morse Code History Lesson  and Puzzle Decoding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morse code is a type of code that is used to send telegraphic information using rhythm. Morse code uses dots and dashes to show the alphabet letters, numbers, punctuation and special characters of a given message. When messages are sent by Morse code, dots are short beeps or clicks or flashes, and dashes are longer ones.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="morse alpha" src="images/morse-code-alphabet.jpg" /&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, who helped invent it. Teletypewriters were invented in the early 20th century with their own codes and gradually replaced Morse code. Other types of technology that are easier to use for communication became even more common. Though it is not widely used, Morse code is still used to communicate on some amateur radios.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned how to encode and decode morse code, first with a pencil and paper, then by writing programs in Python on the pi; being able to decode it through text or by sound! Here is a setup with the pi connected to a breadboard (easily manipulated tool for conveying circuits) and a speaker. By connecting two jumper wires and a button on the breadboard, students wrote programs in Python to relay messages in morse through the speaker!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="morse sound" src="images/morse-pi-setup.jpg" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a fun morse code translator on the &lt;a href="http://morsecode.scphillips.com/translator.html"&gt;SCPhillips&lt;/a&gt; site.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day Two&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;9/21/2016&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Binary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;more on cryptography&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reviewed what we learned of Morse code last week and how it relates to binary i.e Encoding, and decoding. Think of Binary, 0's and 1's, as the language computers 'speak'. When you break a computer down, it is basically a whole lot of 1010101011000's. Something needs to decode this into text so that humans can easily read and understand it. Sure, "only real programmers code in binary", but that would make learning programming a little off-putting!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of ways to learn the Binary Number system, a base two number system. In other words, this number system uses two digits: one and zero. The number system we are most familiar with, the Decimal Number system, a base ten number system. So, this system uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. Students were introduced to binary by learning binary magic tricks, a binary 'piano', and binary flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of the number 21 (in the decimal number system) and 10101 (in the binary number system) using binary flashcards and a binary piano:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="binary 21" src="images/binary-cards-piano.jpg" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day Three&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;9/28/2016&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cryptography&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A formal definition from wiki of Cryptography: the art of witting or solving code. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; To dive into what this means, we used a Caesarian cipher, where the letter place is moved by three. This is a great tool to help understand the important concept of abstraction in computer science. Encoding and decoding this caesarian cipher exercises skills in abstract thinking where you use a symbol to represent something. &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example bit of code we wrote using the Pythonista app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="crypto" src="images/cryptography.jpg" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to Instructor, Davis' &lt;a href="https://github.com/davismohar/CesarCipher"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; with a little more on the python program file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day Four&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;10/05/2016&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Game of Life&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game of life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced "players", by creating patterns with particular properties. &lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; -Just dipping our feet in artificial intelligence. We are always trying to get computers to become as intelligent as humans. Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa a couple examples of our attempts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game of life is 'turing-complete', which means that technically, anything that could be computed, could be computed using the game of life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example on the Tech Em whiteboard of the Game of Life:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="gameoflife" src="images/game-of-life.jpg" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day Five&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;10/12/2016&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Artificial Intelligence and The Turing test&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence and computers are not exactly related. On the other hand, computation and computers do. Humans have been working for a long time at bridging the gap between intelligence and computers. You are probably familiar with that work by using Apple's "Siri", Microsoft's "Cortana", or Amazon's "Alexa". Though, if you have used these devices, you've probably noticed that each one can get a lot of things wrong, or cannot perform every action you want it to. So, you can see we still have some ways to go with bringing intelligence to the "minds" of computers. Artificial Intelligence (the field), "is the study of computer systems that attempt to model and apply the intelligence of the human mind." &lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A British mathematician, Alan Turing is famous for inventing the mathematical model, the &lt;a href="http://www.aturingmachine.com/"&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/a&gt; (no matter the complexity, a machine that can calculate anything that is computable) in 1936. Turing asked the important question: "Can machines think?". According to him, we eventually will be able to make a computer that thinks! &lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; To see if we've reached that point, we have the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test"&gt;Turing Test&lt;/a&gt;. This is a test to determine whether a computer is in fact, intelligent. It is a test to figure out whether a person can be fooled by a computer, into thinking the computer is another person (not a computer). &lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; After ending the discussion we completed a simple &lt;a href="http://csunplugged.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unplugged-20-the_turing_test_0.pdf"&gt;Turing Test activity&lt;/a&gt; to see if the computer can fool us into thinking it is a human.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Future of Computing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What can Watson do for you?" Artificial intelligence talks continued with learning what &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com/watson/what-is-watson.html"&gt;Watson&lt;/a&gt; is, pretty much a cognitive assistant. In other words, a machine to help humans make decisions and take action. So, it helps to increase a person's potential. Powerful stuff! It is not only essential to learn where computer science has started to where we are now, but to learn where we are headed. Learning about this, will help prepare us for using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt; to run code on Amazon's "Alexa" without the use of your own server.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day Six&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;10/12/2016&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Soldering &amp;amp; LED Pendant&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to put together and code a Gemma microcontroller from Adafruit, an 8x8 LED matrix display. We'll use binary numbers, soldering techniques, and patience! Here are some tips from Wray about &lt;a href="http://blog.techemstudios.com/category/hardware.html"&gt;soldering&lt;/a&gt; and more detailed information on the &lt;a href="http://blog.techemstudios.com/led-pendant-follow-up.html"&gt;LED pendant project&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week, we'll put together a TV-B-Gone Kit by using soldering skills we learned from this class.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday after we had gotten everything hooked up, and our Windows installation completed I wanted to take some time to talk to the kids about the importance of computer,  and Internet safety.  We live in an exciting age with the Internet of Things, but with the excitement comes some risk. While it's great having all of these devices online, it makes the attack surface for malicious actors much larger. There is good news though! We can all take steps to greatly reduce our risk of falling victim to scams, viruses, and annoying adware. My goal with this post is to detail what I went over in the presentation, and also provide direct links to the software I recommend on keeping yourself safe online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Threat is Real&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over &lt;strong&gt;169 million personal records&lt;/strong&gt; were exposed in 2015, stemming from 781 publicized breaches across the financial, business, education, government and healthcare sectors. &lt;a href="http://www.idtheftcenter.org/ITRC-Surveys-Studies/2015databreaches.html"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2015, there were &lt;strong&gt;38 percent&lt;/strong&gt; more security incidents detected than in 2014.&lt;a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cyber-security/information-security-survey.html"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;34.2%&lt;/strong&gt; of user computers were subjected to at least one web attack over the year.&lt;a href="https://securelist.com/analysis/kaspersky-security-bulletin/73038/kaspersky-security-bulletin-2015-overall-statistics-for-2015/"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of malicious actors out there, from all across the globe. It can be very hard to prosecute, and find these people because of international laws, but also because they usually take good care in making sure what they do is untraceable back to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am convinced that there are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked and those that will be. And even they are converging into one category: companies that have been hacked and will be hacked again.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robert S. Mueller, III, FBI Director, 2012 &lt;a href="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/speeches/combating-threats-in-the-cyber-world-outsmarting-terrorists-hackers-and-spies"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't protect ourselves from everything, and we are helpless when a company gets hacked. But we can take many steps to help protect ourselves from making it any easier for an attacker to get our information, or infect our computer with malicious software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus Points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Passwords &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Virus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adware &amp;amp; Spyware detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protecting Yourself Online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By looking into these areas, and being aware of what you are doing on the computer you will be ahead of the game, and able to detect, and know what to do if something ever happens!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Strong Passwords&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Strong Passwords" src="http://imgur.com/rMagpJb.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all love a nice, easy, quick password to type in. Something that isn't hard to remember. Guess who else loves those passwords?! Those dudes trying to get your bank account number! The password is going to be your first defense, especially with your online accounts. By creating a strong password you are making it harder for an attacker to guess that password. One of the most popular attacks towards someones password is using a Brute Force attack where they use a dictionary to guess all the combinations of various words. So by creating a password that isn't found in a dictionary, you are a step ahead of the game in protecting yourself. You'll be best protected by using upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols in your password. Make sure to use a minimum of 12 characters when choosing a password, and if you are really worried never use the same password twice. Using a password manager like KeyPassX &lt;a href="https://www.keepassx.org"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; or LastPass &lt;a href="https://lastpass.com"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt; can help you keep track of all these unique, and complicated passwords! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Anti-Virus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses can definitely be a pain, and make your experience frustrating. Anti-Virus programs have evolved over the years, and we have seen many different companies market their latest and greatest. Thankfully for Windows users Microsoft has gotten on board and created &lt;strong&gt;Windows Defender&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a piece of software that comes installed on Windows 8, and Windows 10. Users running systems with versions of Windows pre Windows 8, you will look for &lt;strong&gt;Security Essentials&lt;/strong&gt; which is the same thing. Both of these pieces of software will be free, and included with Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking to add another layer of Anti-Virus, I would suggest looking into Anti-Virus Guard &lt;a href="http://www.avg.com/us-en/homepage"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;, AVG for short. It is a free, anti-virus that will help catch anything that Windows Defender might miss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple users can use the OS X version of AVG to protect themselves from viruses. Apple computers tend to be targeted less because they are less prevalent in the computer population than Windows operating computers. But you still should be aware of the possibilities, and protect yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these are going to be a good first line of defense from most of the main- stream virus that your computer has potential to catch. It's very important to make sure you keep these updated, and are using the latest virus definitions. If your computer does get a virus that you are having trouble removing, look through Google for anything related to that specific virus, or seek out professional assistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adware, Spyware Detection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these types of malicious software aren't going to kill you, they will definitely make your user experience annoying. &lt;strong&gt;Adware&lt;/strong&gt; is known as a type of software that installs and displays ads on the users screen. They work by hijacking the legitimate ads on websites, and display their own. Sometimes even displaying ads outside of the web browser. They usually come from clicking on malicious links, or from installing certain kinds of software that sneak them in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever installing new software always make sure to read the check boxes! Sometimes those check boxes will ask you if you want to install some sketchy ad package! Their hope is that you won't read them, and click next next next! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spyware&lt;/strong&gt; is much more malicious. You can define spyware as any type of malicious software that is meant to spy on the user looking to gather login, and password information. They are looking to get into your email, and your bank accounts. Usually you will get spyware from clicking on malicious links, and downloading fake software that isn't the application you think it is. Always know the sites that you are on, and pay attention to the URL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two pieces of software that I recommend to take care of this would be Malware Bytes&lt;a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;, and Super-Anti Spyware&lt;a href="http://superantispyware.com"&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;. Both have free versions that you can use to help remove these types of software, and help hopefully stop them before even have a chance! You need to make sure that you use the latest versions, and also before running scans, update your virus definitions. Updating your virus definitions can be done inside the application. If you don't want to have the application running all the time, I would suggest to try run it at least twice a month. It can never hurt, and will help to remove any junk that you might not even know you have! They can be sneaky! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Protecting Yourself Online&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do so much online these days! We do our banking, talk to friends, and family. We play video games, and video chat! And with Internet access available practically all over the globe, there are tons of people online, going to the same sites that we all use. Being safe online is a top priority for anyone wanting to protect their personal information, and avoid any types of identity theft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can never over stress the importance of having a strong password. That is going to help you tremendously in avoiding someone being able to guess your password, and getting access to your account. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember to use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. A minimum length of 12-14 characters is suggested. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't use the same password for all your accounts, especially ones you are really trying to protect. This prevents them getting your password from one site, and than being able to compromise all your accounts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a password manager to help keep track of the different sites, and different passwords you create. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Two-Factor Authentication if you available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never &lt;strong&gt;EVER&lt;/strong&gt; reveal any personally identifiable information to strangers online. There shouldn't ever been any reason to, and if someone is asking for that information there intentions should be questioned. Don't trust that just because someone has a Facebook, and pictures that they are who they say they are. You should always be cautious when talking with others online. By never revealing anything about yourself, and potentially using a pesudo first name you can keep yourself safe while navigating the web, and talking to others! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If available for that site,  always use &lt;strong&gt;HTTPS!!!&lt;/strong&gt; HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that will help to encrypt your traffic so if the attacker does get ahold of it, they shouldn't have any idea what it says! There are a couple plugins&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere%20"&gt;[13]&lt;/a&gt; that will force your browser to use HTTPS if available. You can tell if you are using HTTPS when visiting a certain website by looking at the address bar up top and seeing a pad lock. Firefox and Google Chrome will display a green pad lock, and Safari will show gray pad lock. Also the URL will start with HTTPS instead of HTTP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good way to keep the malicious activity found on some websites at bay is the use of an AdBlocker. There are a couple different ones out there, but I would recommend uBlock&lt;a href="https://www.ublock.org"&gt;[11]&lt;/a&gt;, or AdBlockPlus&lt;a href="https://adblockplus.org"&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;. They both do the same thing, so choose either one. You don't need to install both of them. By using a piece of software like this you will be blocking ads, and reduce the chances of clicking on a malicious one. As well as be preventing some of the malicious scripts that hide on some websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phishing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phishing is something that I wanted to mention in this post because I feel that it is a very effective attack for attackers to gain access to peoples personal accounts. And over the years has become a more prevalent threat on the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Phishing" src="http://imgur.com/s3azhQU.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phishing is the practice of sending fake emails that appear to look real, and come from reputable sources. Usually they will be like an email from your bank saying to please reset your password, with a link below that they want you to click. Usually they will even make the email format look exactly like how a legitimate one. But that is the point, to make you think it actually came from your bank! Some tips below for detecting phishing emails: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay very close attention to the senders email address. You can't always count on this to not be spoofed and appear to be actually from the bank, but most of the time you will see something like &lt;em&gt;bankofamerica.blah.silly@loserhacker.com&lt;/em&gt;. So while at first glance it might appear to be from Bank of America, looking a little closer we can see that it definitely didn't, and should be discarded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the email is very vague about who specifically they are contacting that can raise some flags. For example if the message starts with "Hello TechEm, we are contacting to ..." versus just "Hello, we are contacting to ..."  This is important because attackers will send these phishing emails out en masse and usually don't know any information of the recipients. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also just look closely, and read the email before you jump to click on something in it. You might see something out of place, and easily figure out the email is fake. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day if you are really worried that the email might be fake, just ignore it and call the company up directly. Than you can be assured that you aren't replying or clicking anything suspicious. They might even be able to tell you if they sent you an email recently so you know for sure! Better to be safe than sorry! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to read more about phishing, the Federal Trade Commission has written some good information&lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0003-phishing"&gt;[12]&lt;/a&gt; to help people learn about these types of attacks, and other tips on preventing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like mentioned in the beginning we can't always protect ourselves from every threat out there in cyber space. But we can reduce our chances, and make exploring the web much safer for ourselves. We can take steps to prevent sketchy software from installing and infecting our computers. We can use software to detect, and clean up anything that might have been installed under our nose. And we can use methods to make sure our passwords are strong, and our accounts are locked down. Setting up alerts for logins to your accounts is always useful, and using Two-Factor authentication whenever available is the ultimate thing for locking down an account, and keeping the bad guys out.  These are all things we already do every day like locking our houses, using a locked and fire proof filing cabinet or safe. It's just instead of calling you on the phone to scam you, or knocking on your door, they send you an email, or message you through Facebook. Some of the attacks have shifted, and gotten more technical but a lot is very similar to things we already work to protect ourselves against. It's just the attack surface has changed to the computer. So we have to evolve our techniques, and adjust our perspective of the possible avenues of attacks. Thankfully it's not close to impossible, and allows us to remain safe, and avoid having information compromised! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure I've left something out! And I always suggest people to look for themselves, and read through a couple different sites to learn about computer safety, and security. These are the tips, and tricks I have been using to keep myself safe online, and should give you a little overview of where to start if you are interested in protecting yourself more, and different types of software to do so. Please don't hesitant if you have any questions to reach out, and email me. I love talking about computer security, and safety! &lt;/p&gt;
