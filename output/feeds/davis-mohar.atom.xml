&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;9/14/2016&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Intro to Raspberry Pi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create Em started out with discussions on objectives, or desired projects. Since the Raspberry Pi is so versatile, allows for easy manipulation, and provides a mecca for machine learning, we will be completing a slew of projects with this device.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi is essentially a mini computer (pocket-sized). It is a device for non-experienced and experienced programmers alike. By working through projects associated with the pi, its user can learn programming in a hands-on/interactive way. The pi's introduction started with an activity on all of its parts that come with it and what those parts do. For this class we are using the Raspberry Pi 3 model B. The pi is a single board computer with all the components on one board. The point was made that these components are very similar to traditional computers and cell phones, just on a smaller scale.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Morse Code History Lesson  and Puzzle Decoding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morse code is a type of code that is used to send telegraphic information using rhythm. Morse code uses dots and dashes to show the alphabet letters, numbers, punctuation and special characters of a given message. When messages are sent by Morse code, dots are short beeps or clicks or flashes, and dashes are longer ones.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="morse alpha" src="images/morse-code-alphabet.jpg" /&gt; &lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, who helped invent it. Teletypewriters were invented in the early 20th century with their own codes and gradually replaced Morse code. Other types of technology that are easier to use for communication became even more common. Though it is not widely used, Morse code is still used to communicate on some amateur radios.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned how to encode and decode morse code, first with a pencil and paper, then by writing programs in Python on the pi; being able to decode it through text or by sound! Here is a setup with the pi connected to a breadboard (easily manipulated tool for conveying circuits) and a speaker. By connecting two jumper wires and a button on the breadboard, students wrote programs in Python to relay messages in morse through the speaker!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="morse sound" src="images/morse-pi-setup.jpg" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a fun morse code translator on the &lt;a href="http://morsecode.scphillips.com/translator.html"&gt;SCPhillips&lt;/a&gt; site.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day Two&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;9/21/2016&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Binary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;more on cryptography&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reviewed what we learned of Morse code last week and how it relates to binary i.e Encoding, and decoding. Think of Binary, 0's and 1's, as the language computers 'speak'. When you break a computer down, it is basically a whole lot of 1010101011000's. Something needs to decode this into text so that humans can easily read and understand it. Sure, "only real programmers code in binary", but that would make learning programming a little off-putting!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of ways to learn the Binary Number system, a base two number system. In other words, this number system uses two digits: one and zero. The number system we are most familiar with, the Decimal Number system, a base ten number system. So, this system uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. Students were introduced to binary by learning binary magic tricks, a binary 'piano', and binary flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of the number 21 (in the decimal number system) and 10101 (in the binary number system) using binary flashcards and a binary piano:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="binary 21" src="images/binary-cards-piano.jpg" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day Three&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;9/28/2016&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cryptography&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A formal definition from wiki of Cryptography: the art of witting or solving code. &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; To dive into what this means, we used a Caesarian cipher, where the letter place is moved by three. This is a great tool to help understand the important concept of abstraction in computer science. Encoding and decoding this caesarian cipher exercises skills in abstract thinking where you use a symbol to represent something. &lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example bit of code we wrote using the Pythonista app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="crypto" src="images/cryptography.jpg" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a link to Instructor, Davis' &lt;a href="https://github.com/davismohar/CesarCipher"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; with a little more on the python program file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day Four&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;10/05/2016&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Game of Life&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game of life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced "players", by creating patterns with particular properties. &lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; -Just dipping our feet in artificial intelligence. We are always trying to get computers to become as intelligent as humans. Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa a couple examples of our attempts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game of life is 'turing-complete', which means that technically, anything that could be computed, could be computed using the game of life.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example on the Tech Em whiteboard of the Game of Life:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="gameoflife" src="images/game-of-life.jpg" /&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day Five&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;10/12/2016&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Artificial Intelligence and The Turing test&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligence and computers are not exactly related. On the other hand, computation and computers do. Humans have been working for a long time at bridging the gap between intelligence and computers. You are probably familiar with that work by using Apple's "Siri", Microsoft's "Cortana", or Amazon's "Alexa". Though, if you have used these devices, you've probably noticed that each one can get a lot of things wrong, or cannot perform every action you want it to. So, you can see we still have some ways to go with bringing intelligence to the "minds" of computers. Artificial Intelligence (the field), "is the study of computer systems that attempt to model and apply the intelligence of the human mind." &lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A British mathematician, Alan Turing is famous for inventing the mathematical model, the &lt;a href="http://www.aturingmachine.com/"&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/a&gt; (no matter the complexity, a machine that can calculate anything that is computable) in 1936. Turing asked the important question: "Can machines think?". According to him, we eventually will be able to make a computer that thinks! &lt;sup id="fnref:7"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; To see if we've reached that point, we have the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test"&gt;Turing Test&lt;/a&gt;. This is a test to determine whether a computer is in fact, intelligent. It is a test to figure out whether a person can be fooled by a computer, into thinking the computer is another person (not a computer). &lt;sup id="fnref:6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; After ending the discussion we completed a simple &lt;a href="http://csunplugged.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unplugged-20-the_turing_test_0.pdf"&gt;Turing Test activity&lt;/a&gt; to see if the computer can fool us into thinking it is a human.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Future of Computing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What can Watson do for you?" Artificial intelligence talks continued with learning what &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com/watson/what-is-watson.html"&gt;Watson&lt;/a&gt; is, pretty much a cognitive assistant. In other words, a machine to help humans make decisions and take action. So, it helps to increase a person's potential. Powerful stuff! It is not only essential to learn where computer science has started to where we are now, but to learn where we are headed. Learning about this, will help prepare us for using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt; to run code on Amazon's "Alexa" without the use of your own server.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day Six&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;10/12/2016&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Soldering &amp;amp; LED Pendant&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to put together and code a Gemma microcontroller from Adafruit, an 8x8 LED matrix display. We'll use binary numbers, soldering techniques, and patience! Here are some tips from Wray about &lt;a href="http://blog.techemstudios.com/category/hardware.html"&gt;soldering&lt;/a&gt; and more detailed information on the &lt;a href="http://blog.techemstudios.com/led-pendant-follow-up.html"&gt;LED pendant project&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week, we'll put together a TV-B-Gone Kit by using soldering skills we learned from this class.  &lt;/p&gt;

We went over the processor, motherboard, RAM, power supply, solid state drives, and disk drive. Over the first two days, we installed all the parts, and wired everything up. Once the computer was built, they installed Windows 10 onto their computers as well as a variety of other programs such as antimalware, runtimes, and drivers. We then went over computer secuirty and how to best keep themselves and their computers safe from viruses, malware, or phishing. We also discussed troubleshooting steps for both hardware and software issuses so that they will be able to fix any problems that could arise in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the presentations we covered: &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T8ERaT-Cm7jPNVmd2wAVDKt4LAflvoQ5hqoaN9F84ic/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;Computer Parts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WZyjCNaGeupDpLhme4ypItIhnkPwYxD6ut5nj0isg3E/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lJvTJYlD7aN2kW3RDKmoKvHd8Q-TOKdG8H45cWhkQUE/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;Computer Safety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started off the week by diving into the basics of python. We went over basic printing, math functions, and getting user input. We finished the first day up by writing up a calculator that allowed the user to pick which operation they want to use. On day 2, we reviewed the sytax we had learned yesterday and then moved on to create a automatic mad libs program. We went over some more python features such as loops, arrays, and functions and then ended the day by starting a random sentence program that downloaded a list of random words from the internet and then would insert them into our sentence. The next two days we worked on projects such as a coin flip statistic program as well as a graphical program using the turtle library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the code that we worked on is availble on &lt;a href="https://github.com/davismohar/techempython"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; for you to download. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get python installed on your home computer, go to python.org, click on the downloads tab, and then download python 2.7.12 (NOT Python 3.5.2, they are not interchangeable)
You can then run the downloaded file and python should be installed on your computer! You can now run and edit any .py file using the new IDLE program that you just downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="python"></category><category term="coding"></category><category term="pythonista"></category></entry><entry><title>Coding Camp 2015</title><link href="http://blog.techemstudios.com/coding-camp-2015.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-07-21T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Davis Mohar</name></author><id>tag:blog.techemstudios.com,2015-07-21:coding-camp-2015.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;By Davis Mohar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for a great week everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, we split into two groups, beginners and people who already had some experience with coding. The group with experience coding started the week working with python, and the beginner group started out with Lightbot and Hopscotch in order to introduce programming concepts such as finding patterns and creating functions to complete this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advanced group spent the first day on an introduction to python. On the second and third days, we continued with input/output and learned about data stuctures and the turtle library, which provides easy graphics in python. We ended the camp working on some challenges that ranged from more turtle graphics to a dice games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginner group spent the first day in Lightbot, which focuses on pattern recognition. The first half of the second day we started with Hopscotch, which emphasis creating functions to use multiple times. In the second half of the day, we started with python, learning the basic syntax as well as creating a basic calculator. On the third day we added features on to the calculator, such as the ability to use multiple operators and also created a dice rolling simulator using the python random number library. The final day was spent learning the turtle library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Lightbot and Hopscotch can be found on the Apple App Store, There is a free trial version of lightbot as well as the full version for $3. Hopscotch is free on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pythonista, the app we used to write and run python code on the ipads can be downloaded from the App Store for $7 or Python can be downloaded for free to run on your computer &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
(make sure you download Python 2.7.10 and not Python 3.4.3, they have significant differences)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in continuing learning python, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Python-Kids-Playful-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593274076"&gt;Python for Kids&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="coding"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>Minecraft Camp</title><link href="http://blog.techemstudios.com/minecraft-camp.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-29T00:00:00-04:00</published><author><name>Davis Mohar</name></author><id>tag:blog.techemstudios.com,2015-06-29:minecraft-camp.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h4&gt;By Davis Mohar&lt;/h4&gt;
