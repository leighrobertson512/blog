        <p><strong>Everyone did a great job designing their games!</strong>  </p>
<p>Here are some tips to view the games:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your child published a game on Floors,  </p>
<ul>
<li>I individually sent out the links for the game(s) through an email.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your child published a game on Hyperpad, you can find it by going to the Hyperpad website:  </p>
<ul>
<li>create a login  </li>
<li>click Hub located on the navigation bar  </li>
<li>scroll down to Most Recent  </li>
<li>click the View All  </li>
<li>select the game  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To play the game on either Floors or Hyperpad, you would have to play it using an iPad. Maybe down the road, the creators will make a version to play/edit on a PC or MAC.  </p>
<p>I enabled "Branching" for games on Hyperpad. Once you are on the app they will be able to edit their game by clicking Branch (Located next to the Play button by the game). This downloads their game on the account that you just created and it allows them to continue to edit and further publish.  </p>
<p>Publishing on Hyperpad can be tricky. This is due to the images for the required screenshot and icon have certain size specifications. I used the iPhoto App to edit these images to become the correct sizes.  </p>
<p>Feel free to contact me for help if you have any questions with any of this process or editing the game on either app.  </p>
<p>The creators of Hyperpad are very helpful and prompt with replying to any questions.  </p>
<p>Published games will have the option for users to play the game and leave comments for feedback. This is an awesome aspect of publishing; in that, it further exemplifies the design thinking process we used to create these games. They can choose to use this feedback to continue editing their published game.   I mentioned in an earlier post this class,   http://blog.techemstudios.com/ase-coding.html, this process is used extensively to come up with solutions for challenges of all kinds. I hope to further explore this in our Design Thinking and Gaming summer camp. They can choose to use this feedback to continue editing their published game.  </p>

<p><strong>Course Wrap-Up &amp; A Look at Our Design Approach</strong>  </p>
<p>For the second half of the ASE Coding, we learned about the design thinking process and we used this practice to design our own game(s).</p>
<p>We became comfortable with making games on various platforms (Floors, Hyperpad and Gamepress). During the course of our game design, we utilized design thinking by having our rough drafts played by other classmates to provide feedback to one another.</p>
<p>While working from these game design apps, we learned various concepts of computer science and from the coding half of the course; such as, logical thinking, conditions(if this, then..), creating variables.</p>
<p>I will send out individual emails to you all that will have the name of the project(s) the students have been working on so you can get to them. They have been working on their projects in either Floors or Hyperpad, or both.</p>
<p>Design thinking is a user-centered approach to solving everyday problems. I have been using a rough outline of the design thinking process as it pertains to this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Observation  </p>
<ul>
<li>What are your favorite games to play?</li>
<li>Why are they your favorite games?  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brainstorming (design thinking questions)  </p>
<ul>
<li>What makes your favorite games fun to play? [what makes these games fun?]  </li>
<li>What would you include in your game?  </li>
<li>What would you leave out for your game?  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protoyping  </p>
<ul>
<li>Create your game!  </li>
<li>Keep in mind the brainstorming topics and design thinking questions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementation  </p>
<ul>
<li>Test your game  <ul>
<li>what do you like?  </li>
<li>what could you change?  </li>
<li>what's missing? what could you add?  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Collaborate  <ul>
<li>have someone else play your game - vice versa  </li>
<li>get feedback/provide feedback  </li>
<li>repeat the process  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We used this process to make awesome games!  </p>
<p>Note: We are unable to publish projects on Gampress. This app is for the most part, disabled, the creaters of the app moved their efforts to their new app, Hyperpad.  </p>
