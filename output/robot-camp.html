        <h2>Summer 2016 Robot Camp</h2>
<p>Students started their robot camp with new friends and a plethora of unattached hardware: motors, wires, screws, chasis plates, battery holders and more!  </p>
<p>The first part of camp entailed assembling all these parts using screwdrivers and determination. As the campers were guided through the process of putting together their BombiniBots, they were given lessons on each parts' purpose in the make of the robot: the function of each wire connection, which screws held what, and which motor turned this way and that, and how.  </p>
<p><img alt="assemble" src="images/robot-parts.jpg" />
<img alt="guide" src="images/robot-collage.jpg" />  </p>
<p>Once completely assembled and with the help of instructors and interns, campers hooked up their robots to computers via bluetooth or directly and made adjustments to their bots accordingly to ensure proper connections. They learned they could control the movements of their robots by having them connect to their computers wirelessly (bluetooth) or directly connect them to upload written code.  </p>
<p>When the campers' bots paired using bluetooth, the robot movements could be controlled using a Scratch based programming environment. This is a drag-and-drop style of programming. To familiarize themselves with this way of coding, campers learned similar programming concepts by using two other apps, Hopscotch and Lightbot.  </p>
<p>From provided lessons, campers learned the basics of coding/programming to make coding their robot's movements a breeze. For these robots, a program is a series of instructions written (or 'dragged-and-dropped') to have the robot move in particular directions; also, to complete various tasks! These tasks ranged from escaping a maze of desktop computers and TRS-80s, to racing another robot to save a 3D printed robot figure!  </p>
<p><img alt="trs" src="images/robot-TRS.jpg" />
<img alt="maze" src="images/robot-share.jpg" />  </p>
<p>When connected via bluetooth, students can control their robots using the scratch based program. They set up instructions to have keystrokes control its movements, or they set up instructions to have the robots complete a list of commands.  </p>
<p>When the robots are connected directly to the computer, code can be uploaded straight to the robots' arduino compatible board. Once uploaded, the robot was turned on and it was able to run through each step of the uploaded code. This was useful when having the robots move autonomously, i.e. by themselves. This is the 'Roaming' code example. While compelting this program, if the robot's whiskers collided with an object, it would make the adjustments neccessary to move around that object. This is similar to how autonomous vacuum cleaners do their job. While navigating through the maze autonomously, campers had to tweak their code to have it complete the maze smoothly.  </p>

<h3>Mini Overview of your BombiniBot Robot</h3>
<p>BombiniBot has two motors and two tentacles. You can control the speed and direction of motors and read the tentacle values through your program.
It also has an LED on top. You can control the blinking of this LED from your Scratch program. (You can turn it ON, blink it at different speeds or turn it OFF).  </p>
<p>BombiniBot runs on 6 AA batteries. The battery holder is mounted with Velcro in the BombiniBot belly.  </p>
<hr />
<h3>Turning your Robot</h3>
<p>You can use several strategies for turning:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can run one motor slower than the other, and as a result the robot will turn in the direction of the slower motor.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For sharper turn: stop one motor and run the other motor, this results in a sharper turn in the direction of stopped motor.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Precise sharp turn: run one motor in forward direction and the other in reverse direction, this results in the BombiniBot turning sharply in the direction of the reverse motor.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Steps to take to continue coding your robot at home are outlined below:</strong>   </p>
<hr />
<h3>Three Preceding Steps to Control your BombiniBot Robot</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download the <strong>Scratch based programming environment</strong> from <a href="http://www.mindsensors.com/content/76-bombinibot-assembly-instructions-and-downloads">mindsensors.com</a> and choose the windows link or the mac link depending on your operating system.   </p>
<p>i) This will download as a compressed (zip) file, so unzip the folder once it is done downloading.<br />
  i) The folder will shown as 'BombiniBotWin' or 'BombiniBotMac'  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the Arduino drivers <a href="http://www.mindsensors.com/stem-with-robotics/43-bombinibot-kit-teach-robotics-and-scratch-programming">here</a></p>
<p>i) Scroll down till you see <strong>DOWNLOAD</strong>, select this, then select the download file for Arduino CH430 Drivers. Unzip the folder once it has completed downloading.<br />
  i) This will greatly help with pairing the robot successfully.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the <strong>Arduino Environment</strong> on <a href="http://www.mindsensors.com/content/76-bombinibot-assembly-instructions-and-downloads">mindsensors.com</a> Unzip the folder once it has completed downloading.  </p>
<p>i) You will use this when programming your Arduino Compatible Board. 
  i) The folder will be shown as 'arduino-1.6.3-windows' or 'arduino-1.6.3-mac'  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3>Connect your Robot to Bluetooth:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Turn your robot on. <em>If the LED light on your is blinking fast, your robot is ready to pair. If the LED is solid red or is blinking slow, follow the troubleshooting steps below</em>  <ul>
<li>On your computer, open Settings. </li>
<li>Navigate to Devices to get to bluetooth. Make sure bluetooth is 'On'. </li>
<li>Pair your robot to the computer. Your robot number is specified on the robot itself on the top board, the BombiniBot board.    </li>
<li>Under Related Settings, click More Bluetooth Options and select COM Ports. Note the COM Port number for the Outgoing Direction. (I suggest writing the COM Port down for reference).  </li>
<li>Once you have paired your robot and noted the Outgoing COM Port, open the <strong>bbbpanel</strong> found in the BombiniBot folder you downloaded previously.<ul>
<li>Under BombiniBot Port: select the correct Outgoing COM Port you noted earlier.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select Connect  (If connected, your robot's LED light should now be green)  </li>
<li>Once connected, select Run Scratch  <ul>
<li>With the scratch based programming environment that is open, you can add instructions for your robot by dragging and dropping them.  </li>
<li>To have your robot carry out these instructions, click the green flag at the top right of the window and watch your robot perform the steps you told it to perform!  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Run Your Robot using Arduino:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Turn your robot off. <em>If the LED light on your is blinking fast, your robot is ready to pair. If the LED is solid red or is blinking slow, follow the troubleshooting steps below</em>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Connect your robot to your computer with a Printer/Device cable. <ul>
<li>Make sure your robot is turned off and the battery holder unplugged while it is connect to your computer.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your robot does not show its LED light as green, follow the steps for trouleshooting in the next section.  </li>
<li>Run Arduino found in the 'arduino-1.6.3-windows' or 'arduino-1.6.3-mac' folder you downloaded previously.  </li>
<li>Make sure to include the BombiniBot library by navigating to Sketch.  </li>
<li>From here, you can add lines of code for the robot to run (without having it connected to bluetooth)  </li>
<li>This is how we coded the robots to move autonomously.  </li>
<li>The examples provided in the 'arduino-1.6.3' folder.<ul>
<li>To do this, select the BombiniBot folder under examples and select the examples to be opened with Arduino.</li>
<li>From here, we were introduced to having our robots move autonomously. We tweaked the arudino code examples to uniquely maneuver our robots.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To Upload the arduino code for your robot to carry out the instructions, click Upload. Your robot should show its LED light as green. Uplug the robot. Connect the battery holder and turn on the power to the robot.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Troubleshooting your Robot!</h3>
<ul>
<li>If your robot's LED light is a solid red, follow these steps:  <ul>
<li>Open up your command prompt (on Windows) or your Terminal (On Mac) <ul>
<li>For Windows I would suggest opening the 'Power Shell' -you can use almost all of the same commands as in the Terminal on Mac.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Navigate to the BombiniBotWin or BombiniBotMac folder  </li>
<li>For Windows, type prog.bat COM17 (or the COM Port number you noted earlier)  </li>
<li>For Mac, type prog.bash COM17 (or the COM Port number you noted earlier)  </li>
<li>Then hit enter  </li>
<li>After this program runs, your robot will show a green light (if you have your robot directly plugged in to run arduino) or will blink red (if you are trying to connect via bluetooth) and is now ready to accept instructions!  </li>
<li>Now go back to Arduino and upload the code  <br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BQvLqbQ0q_Q">Follow the steps in this video link to run the prog.bash/prog.bat</a>  </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Further issues could be due to the 'whiskers' or antennae on the robot.</p>
<p>From the mindsensors.com overview of the BombiniBot, here is a close-up of the whiskers' location and a bit on what they do<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:  </p>
<p><img alt="whiskers" src="images/robot-whiskers.jpg" />
<img alt="whiskers testing" src="images/robot-auto.jpg" />  </p>
<hr />
<h3>Hardware Checks &amp; Double Checks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Verify all of your connections are solid, and cables secured in their correct homes.   </li>
<li>Make sure your batteries are inserted into the pack correctly, facing the right way.  </li>
<li>Confirm you've fully attached the battery connector to the battery pack. Secure the battery back on the chassis, and make sure it isn't going to slide out!  </li>
<li>Pay attention to your whiskers, and make sure they aren't touching any parts of the PCB board. You can loosen the screws to realign them, and then tighten the screws back up to secure them.  </li>
<li>When you're finished tinkering with your BombiniBot make sure to switch off the power!  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Challenges During the Camp:</h3>
<p><strong>Challenge One:</strong>    </p>
<p>Get yourself familiar with Scratch, and the different commands you can issue your robot. For your first challenge, navigate through the obstacle course. Program one long Scratch program to make it through the whole course.  </p>
<p>If you are having trouble, trying using a pencil, and paper and writing down and drawing the route your robot will need to take to navigate the course. As well as making sure to test your program as you go along to work out any of the bugs early on!  </p>
<p>Bonus: Navigate through the obstacle course, turn around, and navigate back through it returning to where you started!  </p>
<p><img alt="go" src="images/robot-race.jpg" />  </p>
<p><strong>Challenge Two:</strong>    </p>
<p>Using the Arduino IDE, load up the Roam example program onto your BombiniBot. This program makes your Bombini roam anywhere until it bumps into something, which triggers it to back up, and continue on it's path.   </p>
<p>Currently when it backs up, it will back up in the same direction, no matter which whisker was triggered.  </p>
<p>Program your Bombini to back up to the left when the left whisker is triggered, and to the right when the right whisker is triggered.  </p>
<p>Bonus: Switch it around so left reverses right, and right reverses left! Also try to incorporate a 360 into your reverse algorithm!  </p>
<hr />
<p>We hope our campers enjoy their robots and have a great rest of the summer!  </p>
